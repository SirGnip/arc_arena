# Revision History

- 1.0.0: migrated code to GitHub, added ability to package with setup.py, extracted shared code into `gnp_pygame`, no attempts at cleanup.
- pre-GitHub (2006, probably even earlier): a big, messy uber-repo-ish kinda thing with tons of random Python code, which included this game. I creatively called the game "Snake".
